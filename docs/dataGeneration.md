# Using AI to generate synthetic data

This sample includes a DataGenerator console application located in the seedata/DataGenerator folder. This application is used to create [synthetic data](https://learn.microsoft.com/ai/playbook/capabilities/experimentation/synthetic-data-generation) that could be used for testing and validation of the application; it does this by using OpenAI models that are hosted in the Azure OpenAI service. An example of the generated data, called seed data in this sample, can be found in the seeddata/dev and seeddata/test folders.

Examples of the different types of data generation can be find in the seeddata/DataGenerator/Generators folder, where each type of output data is represented by a class that is used to generate that data. Each class inherits from a `CategoryGenerator` class that defines the following core behavior:

* `GetChatCompletion()` - Configuring OpenAI and setting it up to work well data generation & JSON responses
* `GetAndParseJsonChatCompletion()` - Calling OpenAI models to reliably request JSON results and parse JSON from responses. It also demonstrates resiliency with retry logic for when API requests fail.

Other interesting notes about the implementation

* Each generator class includes a prompt that is tailored to generate the data
* The `ManualPdfConverter` class demonstrates one way to generate PDF data
* Data tailored for test scenarios is generated by the `EvalQuestionGenerator`. The output from this generator can be modified to define "ground truth" - examples of question and answer pairs that would be considered correct for the application.
